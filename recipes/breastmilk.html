  <p>After looking at this image for far too long, in the creation of this website, I am even more convicted that the key to humanity lies somewhere in there.</p>
  <h3>Here is how to make it:</h3>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A man and woman with able bodies and able minds.</li>
    <li> A healthy relationship between the man and woman.</li>
    <li>A secure financial situation is preferred and expected but not required.</li>
  </ul>
The beautiful thing about this recipie is it comes together by itself once you find the ingredients. The hard part is finding these ingredients.
<h3>Here are the steps to finding them:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go outside, touch some grass, talk to other human beings, be useful, find a job, live on your own, make friends, find something you enjoy doing.</li>
    <li>Take care of yourself, clean house, exercise, eat healthy, read, make things, be yourself, be free like a kid again.</li>
    <li>Find someone of the opposite sex who you admire. Befriend them, show them the world you have created. Look into their world.</li>
    <li>Combine your worlds. Make things together. Keep making things together.</li>
    <li>Make a child together</li>
  </ol>
  There you go, the sacred food has been obtained. It has not only brought you pleasure, it has brought you happiness, a partner, and family. Treat them well, don't forget all they mean to you, thank God for them.
  <p>It is missing something though, right? What are you to eat while on your journey to obtain the sacred sauce? <p>Ah, I know, the <a href="/recipes/wafflehouse.html" > Waffle House Special</a>. </p>
